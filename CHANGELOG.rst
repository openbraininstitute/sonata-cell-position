- Add new nexus endpoint on aws.
- Fix gpfs symlink.
- Ensure that pip doesn't use any cache.
- Add stopasgroup to supervisord to stop the app subprocesses.


Version 2024.7.4
-----------------

- Unify docker images:

    - add supervisord to run nginx
    - upgrade docker image to python 3.12
    - change listening port to 8000
    - run the image as readonly locally, to simulate the k8s deployment
    - add Makefile
    - update README


Version 2024.7.3
-----------------

- Return the correct CORS headers even when returning responses cached by nginx.


Version 2024.7.2
-----------------

- Temporarily pin libsonata==0.1.24.


Version 2024.7.1
-----------------

- Add Nexus integration [NSETM-2283]:

  - The authentication token should be provided in the ``Nexus-Token`` request header in all the ``/circuit`` endpoints.
    If not provided, it's still possible to retrieve resources from Nexus if they aren't private, or from any explicit gpfs path if provided.
  - The Nexus endpoint and bucket can be specified in the request headers ``Nexus-Endpoint`` and ``Nexus-Bucket``.
  - Support Nexus ``circuit_id`` instead of ``input_path`` as a parameter in all the ``/circuit`` endpoints.
  - Retrieve and cache the required resources from Nexus.
  - Retrieve hierarchy.json from Nexus and cache the loaded RegionMap.
  - Add the internal ``/auth`` endpoint, called by the reverse proxy to check the authorization of the user with Nexus.


Version 2024.6.1
-----------------

- Update CORS origins. [BBPP154-256]
- Rewrite circuit caching logic: use a LRUCache, store to disk a partial circuit config with converted node_sets.
- Execute libsonata calls in a subprocess when they are I/O bound. [NSETM-2282]
- Rename endpoint ``/circuit/downsample`` to ``/circuit/sample``.
- Drop support for directly loading ``.h5`` files.
- Upgrade Dockerfile and tests to python 3.11.


Version 2024.1.1
-----------------

- Simplify tox.ini with docker-compose.yml.
- Tune nginx parameters:

  - improve caching performance in accordance with https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-caching-guide/#Fine%E2%80%91Tuning-the-Cache-and-Improving-Performance
  - enable gzip compression for known formats:

    - The files are compressed on the fly if the client supports compression, while the cached files aren't compressed when stored.
    - Files with content-type ``application/vnd.apache.parquet`` are not compressed, because they are already compressed by default using the snappy algorythm.
    - Files with content-type ``application/vnd.apache.arrow.file`` are not compressed, although it seems that the only compression currently supported by Arrow is dictionary compression.

Version 2023.12.5
-----------------

- Automate release after tag: when a tag is pushed or added through the GitLab UI, the Docker images are published to the registry and a release is created.

Version 2023.12.4
-----------------

- Tune the reverse proxy parameters:

  - increase inactive time to 24h
  - use min_free instead of max_size
  - exclude /health and /version from the cache
  - change the listening port from 8000 to 8040

Version 2023.12.3
-----------------

- Use nginx-unprivileged as the base image for the reverse proxy.

Version 2023.12.2
-----------------

- Add a reverse proxy in front of the service.

Version 2023.12.1
-----------------

- When querying a circuit, check that each specified region can be resolved to region ids.
- Update ``hierarchy.json``.


Version 2023.11.2
-----------------

- Added new endpoints: /circuit/attribute_names, /circuit/attribute_dtypes, /circuit/attribute_values
- Changed /circuit/downsample from GET to POST.
- Fix json serialization in case of validation error with pydantic v2.
- Move query parameters to arguments.


Version 2023.11.1
-----------------

- Upgrade to Pydantic v2.
- Upgrade requirements.txt.
- Forbid extra attributes in POST endpoints, to prevent potential mistakes in query parameters.
- The endpoint ``/circuit/count`` now accepts only 0 (all) or 1 node populations, for consistency with other endpoints.
- Explicitly require libsonata>=0.1.24 where toJSON() correctly serializes node_sets with node_id.
- Raise the error "nodesets with `node_id` aren't currently supported" only when it's specified a node_set referencing node_id, directly or in a compound expression.


Version 2023.08.1
-----------------

- Improve error handling.


Version 2023.07.1
